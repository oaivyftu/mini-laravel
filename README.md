## 🎯 Purpose

Many developers use Laravel without fully understanding what happens behind the scenes.

This project helps you learn:
- How routing works
- How controllers are resolved
- How dependency injection is implemented
- How MVC fits together internally

Instead of treating Laravel as a black box, you build the core concepts yourself.

- MVC architecture (Model – View – Controller)
- Custom routing system
- Controllers and actions
- Dependency Injection Container
- Service binding and resolution
- Request handling
- Basic view rendering
- Configuration management
- PSR-4 style autoloading
